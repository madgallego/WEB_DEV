        If you feel lonely, I could be lonely with you
        Tell me, baby, why do you seem so blue?

        Why are we so complicated?
        Maybe love is overrated

        I'm tired of waitin', I was never good at sports
        Save the games for the girls on the tennis court
        Say you need me, but lately, you feel unsure
        Come on to me, come on to me, I need more

        Ooh
        Ooh

        If you feel broken, promise I won't break your heart
        If you shatter, I won't let you fall apart

        Why are we so complicated?
        Love's a word I've always hated

        I'm tired of waitin', I was never good at sports
        Save the games for the girls on the tennis court

        Say you need me, but lately, you feel unsure
        Come on to me, come on to me, I need more

        It always feels like
        I need more
        Jesus Christ, you're so confusing
        If we keep score
        Bet my money that I'm losing
